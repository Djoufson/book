# Booky 📚

Booky is an opinionated open source project to showcase microservices best practices from my (Djoufson) personal experience and preferences.

# Project overview

The project is a booking system, that basically enables users to buy and download books through a mobile application or the website.
Additionally, authors can subscribe to a plan and upload their books on the platform.

# Features

The below list describes a brief overview of what the system should be capable of,
and the current status of each feature

# Getting started

Do you want to try this on your own? Here are the steps to follow to do so.

## Prerequisites

- Clone the booky repository: https://github.com/Djoufson/booky
- (Windows only) Install Visual Studio. Visual Studio contains tooling support for .NET Aspire that you will want to have. [Visual Studio 2022 version 17.9 Preview](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/preview/). 

    During installation, ensure that the following are selected:
    - `ASP.NET and web development` workload.
    - `.NET Aspire SDK` component in `Individual components`.

- Install the latest [.NET 8 SDK](https://github.com/dotnet/installer#installers-and-binaries)
- On Mac/Linux (or if not using Visual Studio), install the Aspire workload with the following commands:
    ```powershell
    dotnet workload update
    dotnet workload install aspire
    dotnet restore booky.Web.slnf
    ```
- Install & start Docker Desktop:  https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/

## Running the solution

> [!WARNING]
> Remember to ensure that Docker is started

* (Windows only) Run the application from Visual Studio:
  - Open the `booky.Web.slnf` file in Visual Studio
  - Ensure that `booky.AppHost.csproj` is your startup project
  - Hit Ctrl-F5 to launch Aspire


* Or run the application from your terminal:
    ```powershell
    dotnet run --project src/eShop.AppHost/eShop.AppHost.csproj
    ```
    then look for lines like this in the console output in order to find the URL to open the Aspire dashboard:
    ```sh
    Now listening on: http://localhost:15040
    ```
